#Welcome to my Giphy App

[DEMO ME HERE](http://enigmatic-springs-91293.herokuapp.com/)

###This app uses the giphy api to call and find cartoon gifs that users and enter or click on the pre-filled buttons to display cartoon related gifs! 

###Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, and APIs.

###Difficulties/Learned Skills
It took some time to apply opaque overlay on the specific gifs that have not been clicked on, and to have the gifs react to a user's click was difficult too. Creating appropriately nested divs and using CSS ::hover properties made this action possible. 

####All in all, this was a great fun project to learn, and style. I personally love cartoons and being able to work with these gifs made my time just that much more enjoyable.
